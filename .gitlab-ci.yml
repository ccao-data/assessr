# TEMPLATE GITLAB-CI FOR CCAO R PACKAGES

# This CI script creates the R environment necessary to build and test a package
# It is broken down into three overall stages:
# 1. BUILD. Builds the actual R package in the same way one would in RStudio
# 2. TEST. Runs unit tests and checks on the package code
# 3. PAGES. Builds documentation into GitLab Pages using pkgdown

# This setup uses dependency caching to speed up build times, see below for
# more details

# Base R image to build the package with
# Should be version locked to the highest version most CCAO employees are using
image: rocker/r-ver:4.1.0

# Defining static variables used throughout the CI pipeline
variables:
  DOCKER_DRIVER: "overlay2" # Docker FS driver, don't change this
  GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: "recursive" # Set how GitLab handles submodules
  # If a package has a linux dependency that isn't already listed, add it here
  APT_DEPS: "libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libgit2-dev pandoc git libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev"

# Cache settings. R libraries are installed into the renv cache based
# on the libraries listed in the DESCRIPTION file. These libraries are then
# copied between each build as a .zip file. This mitigates the need to reinstall
# libraries for every build (which takes a long time). The cache will be re-used
# until the DESCRIPTION file changes

# Junit format that can be read by GitLab CI to display test results
# 3) Test coverage report that is output to the build logs of each pipeline
# This output gets scraped by GitLab and turned into a coverage badge
